Each field has a NOTE file that gives the start and end UTs

*** The observations for Dec 19 may be dropped if other programs need
    this time, because it is a half-night with limited time.

Please observe fields 1-15 repeatedly until time runs out.

If telescope hits limit, move to next possible field.  However, this
shouldn't happen, although it might come very close.
