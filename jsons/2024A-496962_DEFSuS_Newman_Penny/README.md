- Observe defsus_main_feb_30m00s.json once
- If photometric and there is a script ending in cal_??m??s.json, observe two recommended standard star fields then the *cal*.json script
- Observe defsus_main_feb_30m00s.json once
- If there is still time, run defsus_extra_54m30s.json until time runs out

Note that the above will require far more time than is available on any given night.
