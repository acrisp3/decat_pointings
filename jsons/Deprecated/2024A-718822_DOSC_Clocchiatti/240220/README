json files to run on Feb 20th

Duration of jsons is:

OMLApex.240220_z1.json: 36.0 minutes
OMLApex.240220_xi.json: 13.0 minutes
OMLApex.240220_ri.json: 41.0 minutes
ShallowApex.240220.json: 24.0 minutes

Thinking of the Moon, I think that the preferred order of observations should be the same as the list (OMLApex.240220_z1.json, OMLApex.240220_xi.json, OMLApex.240220_ri.json, ShallowApex.240220.json)
